# BFS-DFS
Write a program in C++ to perform BFS and DFS in a graph to find the set of connected
components. You can perform your experiments on the attached test files which contains the
description of a graph as adjacency list. The program should do the following:

A. Read and store the graph in adjacency list form. Convert and display the graph in
adjacency matrix form.

B. In the adjacency matrix form, apply DFS from any vertex given by the user (also keep the
option of randomly choosing a vertex) and display the connected components in the
graph.

C. In the adjacency matrix form, apply BFS from any vertex given by the user (also keep the
option of randomly choosing a vertex) and determine if the graph is a bipartite graph.
